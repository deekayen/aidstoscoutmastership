# IV. Making a Career

From a national point of view we have too many drones in our social hive, both amon our well-to-do classes and among the poor.

We are a comparatively small nation in numbers, and we need the services of every man of our race if we are to keep our place in teh heavy competition of trades and manufactures that is coming on around us. Yet there is a fearful waste of human material in Great Britain to-day. This is mainly due to ineffective training. The general mass of bosy are not taight to like work. Even when theya re taguth handicrafts or business qualities, they are not shown how to apply these to making a career, nor is the flame of ambition kindled in them. Where they happen to be square pegs they are too often placed in round holes. Whether it is the fault of the schoolmaster, or the parent, or the system of education, one cannot say, but the fact remains that it is so. Consequently, those boys who have not got these gifts naturally are allowed to drift and to become wasters. They are a misery to themselves and a burden—even in some cases, a danger—to the State. And the large proportion of those who do make some sort of a success would undoubtedly do better were they trained in a more practical way. In the Boy Scouts we can do something to remedy these evils. We can take some steps towards giving even the poorest boy a start and a chance in life equipped, at any rate, with hope and a handicraft.

*How?* Naturally one's thoughts run to handcraft Badges. Though we call these "Handicrafts," they are, with our standard of tests, little more than "Hobbies." This, however, is part of our policy of leading the boys on with small and easy beginnings; and these Hobbies become more specialised as vocational training for the Senior Scouts. In the meantime, hobbies have their value; through these the boy learns to use his fingers and his brain, and to take a pleasure in work. For one boy these may remain his hobbies for years; for another they may lead to craftsmanship which will give him a career. In either case, the boy is not so likely to become a waster later on. Hobbies are an antidote to Satan's little games.

But hobbies or handicrafts are not likely to make a career for a boy without the help of certain moral qualities. Thus, the craftsman must have self-discipline. He must adapt himself to the requirements of his employer and of his fellow-workers, he must keep himself sober, and efficient, and willing.

He must have energy, and that depends on the amount he has of ambition, of skill, of resourcefulness, and of good health.

Now, how do we apply these in the Boy Scout's training? The progressive steps by which you work up to them with the boys, begin on the right of the table.

## The Scoutmaster's Share

So much for the lines on which a boy can be practically prepared through Scouting for making a career.

But this only prepares him. It is still in the power of his Scoutmaster to give him further help to making that career a successful one.

First, by showing the lad ways by which he can perfect the superficial instruc- tion received as a Scout; whereby, for instance, he can develop his hobbies into handicrafts. The Scoutmaster can show him where to get higher technical educa- tion, how to get scholarships or apprenticeships, how to train himself for particular professions, how to invest his savings, how to apply for jobs, and so on.

Secondly, by himself knowing the different kinds of employment agencies and how to use them, the terms of service in various professions, the Scoutmaster can give the lad invaluable help, by advising him, on his knowledge of his qualifications, as to which line of life he is best fitted for. All this means that the Scoutmaster must himself look around and inform himself fully on these and like points. By taking a little trouble himself he can make successful lives for many of his boys.

## The Necessary Qualities for Success

Mr. Gordon Selfridge has very kindly given me some ideas on training lads for careers in large business houses. He is a great believer in the saying of Robert Louis Stevenson: "To travel hopefully is a better thing to arrive, and the true success is to labour."

"One of the best things in this world is progress in the right direction."

One of the maxims which Mr. Selfridge impresses on his employees in this: "A man should always act as if he had a serious and clever competitor close behind him, so that he is continually putting forth his best efforts to keep the imaginary competitor from winning his place."

The guide book which Mr. Selfridge issues for the assistance of his employees shows how the following points, which we inculcate in the Boy Scouts, are of greatest value to a young fellow in getting on in his career in a big business house. *Strict adherance to instructions,* with the feeling that such obedience is "playing the game" for the good of the business.

*Energy* and making best use of the time available. "Waste of time where so many are employed is a very serious matter. If one hundred people waste only five minutes each day, the loss is more than eight hours, or a hundred days in a year."

*Courtesy*: "We would have the members of our staff courteous to one another." "Impress visitors or customers that they are welcome."

"It is attractive to customers to be served by assistance whose manners show happiness in what they are doing."

"Those who come merely to look, may become good customers if merchandise is shown them tactfully and cheerfully."

*Intelligence*: "An employee should not be content merely to know his own groove in the business, but should develop some general knowledge of its other branches, and so be able both to advise customers and to quality himself for higher posts."

*Neatness in dress and appearance*: "These go a long way to commending an applicant for employment or for promotion."

*Perseverance*: "In my opinion, two of the qualities which will undoubtedly carry one far along the path of success are *concentration* and *perseverance*.

"You cannot succeed by making an effort in fits and starts; on the contrary, a sustained and steady effort is necessary. Hence it comes about that the 'sticker' beats the merely clever man so often in the race of life."

Personally, I fully endorse these ideas, and if I were asked to sum up all in a single motto for guiding a boy to success in his profession, I should say—

> *"Stick to it, and make yourself indispensable."

On that text, you can preach a very practical sermon and frame a useful training. It is encouraging to a lad, even if he is only an errand boy, to know that if he does his errands so well that his master feels he could not get a better boy, he is safely on the road to promotion. But he must stick to it, and not be led aside by fits and disinclination or annoyance; if he gives way to these he will never succeed. Patience and perseverance win the day. "Softly, softly catchee monkey."

## "Pioneering" as a First Step

The first step towards getting a Scout to take up handiwork is most easily effected in camp, in the practice of hut-building, tree-felling, bridge-building, improvising camp utensils, such as pot-hooks and plate-racks, etc., tent-making, mat-weaving with the camp-loom, and so on, as suggested in *Scouting for Boys*. The boys find these tasks to be practical and useful to their comfort in the camping season. After making a start on these, they will be the more keen to go in for such hobbies in the winter evenings, in the club, as will bring them badges in return for proficiency, and money in return for skilful work. In that way they soon grow into ardent, energetic workers.

I commend to your notice the practical suggestions on this head, given by Mr. Ben Wilde, in the *Scoutmaster's Training Course* (No. 2 Birmingham), on the subject of "Badges and How They Should be Won."

## Proficiency Badges (Merit Badges)

Proficiency Badges are established with a view to developing in each lad the taste for hobbies or handicrafts, one of which may ultimately give him a career and not leave him hopeless and helpless on going out into the world.

The Badges are merely intended as an encouragement to a boy to take up a hobby or occupation and to make some sort of progress in it; they are a sign to an outsider that he has done so; they are, not intended to signify that he is a master in the craft he is tested in. If once we make Scouting into a formal scheme of serious instruction in efficiency, we miss the whole point and value of Scout training, and we trench on the work of the schools without the trained experts for carrying it out. We want to get all our boys along through cheery self-development from within and not through the imposition of formal instruction from without.

But the object of the Badge System in Scouting is also to give the Scoutmaster an instrument by which he can stimulate keenness on the part of every and any boy to take up hobbies that can be helpful in forming his character or developing his skill.

It is an instrument which - if applied with understanding and sympathy - is designed to give hope and ambition even to the dullest and most backward, who would otherwise be quickly outdistanced and so rendered hopeless in the race of life. It is for this reason that the standard of proficiency is purposely left undefined. Our standard for Badge earning is not the attainment of a certain level of quality of knowledge or skill, but the **amount of effort the boy has put into acquiting such knowledge or skill**. This brings the most hopeless case on to a footing of equal possibility with his more brilliant or better-off brother.

An understanding Scoutmaster who has made a study of his boys' psychology can thus give to the boy an encouraging handicap, such as will give the dull boy a fair start alongside his betterbrained brother. And the backward boy, in whom the inferiority complex has been born through many failures, can have his first win or two made easy for him so that he is led to intensify his efforts. If he is a trier, no matter how clumsy, his examiner can accord him his Badge, and this generally inspires the boy to go on trying till he wins further Badges and becomes normally capable.

The examination for Badges is not competitive, but just a test for the individual. The Scoutmaster and the examiner must therefore work in close harmony, judging each individual case on its merits, and discriminating where to be generous and where to tighten up.

Some are inclined to insist that their Scouts should be firstrate before they can get a Badge. That is very right, in theory; you get a few boys pretty proficient in this way - but our object is to get all the boys interested. The Scoutmaster who puts his boys at an easy fence to begin with will find them jumping with confidence and keenness, whereas if he gives them an upstanding stone wall to begin, it makes them strong.

At the same time, we do not recommend the other extreme, namely, that of almost giving away the Badges on very slight knowledge of the subjects. It is a matter where examiners should use their sense and discretion, keeping the main aim in view.

There is always the danger of Badge-hunting supplanting Badge-earning. Our aim is to make boys into smiling, sensible, self-effacing, hardworking citizens, instead of showy, self-indulgent boys. The Scoutmaster must be on the alert to check Badge- hunting and to realise which is the Badge-hunter and which is the keen and earnest worker.

Thus the success of the Badge System depends very largely on the Scoutmaster himself and his individual handling of it.

## Self-Expression

Our Art Badge is devised to lead boys on to express their ideas graphically from their own observation or imagination without attempting thereby to be or to imitate artists. By encouraging drawing, however crude, on the part of the youngster, he can be led on to recognise beauty in color or in form, to realise that even in sordid surroundings there may yet be light and shadow, color and beauty.

A further stage in his education can be brought about by getting him to practice mental photography, that is to notice the details of a scene or incident or person, and fix these in his mind, and then to go and reproduce them on paper.

This teaches observation in the highest degree. Personally I have found by prac- tice that one can develop a certain and considerable power in this direction.

Rhythm is a form of art which comes naturally even to the untrained mind, whether it be employed in poetry or music or in body exercises. It gives a balance and order which has its natural appeal even and especially among those closest to nature-savages. In the form of music it is of course most obvious and universal. The Zulu War Song when sung by four or five thousand warriors is an example of rhythm, in music, poetry and bodily movement combined.

The enjoyment of rendering music is common to all the human family, The song as a setting to words enables the soul to give itself expression which, when adequately done, brings pleasure both to the singer and to his hearer.

Through his natural love of music the boy can be linked up with poetry and sentiment as by a natural and easy transition. It opens a ready means to the Scoutmaster of teaching happiness to his lads and at the same time of raising the tone of their thoughts.

Play-acting also ought to form part of every boy's education for self-expression.

At school I was encouraged to do a lot of play-acting and I have thanked my stars ever since that I did so. For one thing it taught me to learn yards of stuff by heart; also accustomed me to speak clearly and without nervousness before a lot of people; and it gave me the novel joy of being someone else for a time.

It led one to know the beauties of Shakespeare and other authors, to feel, while expressing them, the emotions of joy and sorrow, love and sympathy.

Above all it gave one the pleasure and happiness of giving pleasure to other people at times when they needed it.

Many troops are giving entertainments in the winter months and are thus not only earning satisfactory additions to their funds, but are giving good training to their boys and pleasure to others.

## From Hobby to Career

Hobbies, handcraft, intelligence and health are preliminary steps for developing love of work and ability to carry on, which are essential to successful work. The second stage is fitting the young worker to the right kind of work.

The best workers, like the happiest livers, look upon their work as a kind of game: the harder they play the more enjoyable it becomes. H. G. Wells has said:-

> I have noticed that so called great men are really boys at heart, that is, they are boys in the eagerness of their enjoyment of their task. They work because they like to work, and thus their work is really play to them. The boy is not only father to the man, but he is the man and does not disappear at all.

Ralph Parlette says truly:-

> Play is Loving to do things, and Work is Having to do things.

In Scouting we try to help the boys acquire this attitude, by making them person- ally enthused in subjects that appeal to them individually, and that will be helpful to them later on.

We do this first and foremost through the fun and jollity of Scouting. The boys can then by progressive stages be led on naturally and unconsciously to develop themselves for their future.

## Employment

The Scoutmaster, by watching and studying the individual character and ability of each boy, can to some extent recognise the line of life for which he is best fitted.

But he should realise that the question of employment is one for the parents and the boy himself to decide.

It is then a matter of consultation with the parents, and for cautioning them against putting their square peg of a son into a round hole of employment for the sake of immediate monetary return. Get them and the boy himself to look well ahead and to see ulterior possibilities that lie open to him, provided that his start is made on the right lines.

Here it is important to discriminate between those employments which offer a future to the boy and those which lead to nothing - so-called "blind alley" jobs. These latter often bring in good money for the time being, to increase the weekly in- come of the family, and are, therefore, adopted for the boy by the parents regardless of the fact that they give no opening to him for a man's career afterwards.

Those which promise a future need careful selection with regard to the lad's capabilities, and they can be prepared for, while he is yet a Scout. A skilled employment is essentially better than an unskilled one for the boy's future success in life. But care should be taken that consideration of this question is not left until the time is past for a boy to conform to the standards and rules for entering into the desired career.
