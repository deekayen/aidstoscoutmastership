# V. Service for Others

The attributes which we have so far been studying in the course of training, as tending to make our boys into manly, healthy, happy working citizens, are, to a great extent, selfish ones designed for the good of the individual. We now come to the fourth quality, and that is where, by developing his outlook, he gives out good to others.

Here is a summary of the steps by which Scouting helps to attain this object.

## Development of Outlook: Reverence

Development of outlook naturally begins with a respect for God, which we may best term "Reverence."

*Reverence to God and reverence for one's neighbour and reverence for oneself as a servant of God*, is the basis of every form of religion. The method of expression of reverence to God varies with every sect and denomination. What sect or denomination a boy belongs to depends, as a rule, on his parents' wishes. It is they who decide. It is our business to respect their wishes and to second their efforts to inculcate reverence, whatever form of religion the boy professes.

It must be remembered that we have in our Movement boys of almost every religious belief, and it is, therefore, impossible to lay down definite rules for guidance in religious teaching.

The following is the attitude of the Scout Movement as regards religion, approved by the heads of all the different denominations on our Council:—

"*(a) It is expected that every Scout shall belong to some religious denomination, and attend its services.*
"*(b) Where a Troop is composed of members of one particular form of religion, it is hoped that the Scoutmaster will arrange such denomi- national religious observances and instruction as he, in consultation with its Chaplain or other religious authority, may consider best.*
"*(c) Where a Troop consists of Scouts of various religions they should be encouraged to attend the service of their own denomination, and in camp, any form of daily prayer and of weekly Divine service should be of the simplest character, attendance being voluntary.*"

If the Scoutmaster takes this pronouncement as his guide he cannot go far wrong.

*Training*.—I am perfectly convinced that there are more ways than one by which reverence may be inculcated. The solution depends on the individual character and circum- stances of the boy, whether he is a "hooligan" or a "mother's darling." The training that may suit the one may not have much effect on the other. It is for the teacher, whether Scoutmaster or Chaplain, to select the right one.

While I am speaking on religous training in England, please don't think that I am reiterating the theory which is so lavishly written on this particular subject. I speak from a fairly wide personal experience, having had some thousands of young men through my hands, and my experience only tallies with that of most authorities whom I have consulted. The conclusion come to is that the actions of a very large proportion of our men are, at present, very little guided by religious conviction.

This may be attributed to a great extent to the fact that often *instruction* instead of *education* has been employed in the religious training of the boy, and that in some instances the teaching is undertaken by people who have no real experience or proper training for the work.

The consequence has been that the best boys in the Bible-class or Sunday School have grasped the idea, but in many cases they have, by perfection in the letter, missed the spirit of the teaching and have become zealots with a restricted outlook, while the majority have never really been enthused, and have, as soon as they have left the class or school, lapsed into indifference and irreligion, and there has been no hand to retain them at the critical time of their lives, *i.e.* sixteen to twenty-four.

The disappointing results in religious training have been recognised by the authorities, and the more thorough training now inaugurated for teachers in Sundy Schools and the like promises a very different result for religious education in the future.

It is not given to every man to be a good teacher of religion, and often the most earnest are the greatest failure—and without knowing it.

We have, fortunately, a number of exceptionally well-qualified men in this respect among our Scoutmasters, but there must also be a number who are doubtful as to their powers, and where a man feels this, he does well to get a Chaplain, or other experienced teacher, for his Troop.

On the practical side, however, the Scoutmaster can in every case do an immense amount towards helping the religious teacher, just as he can help the schoolmaster by inculcating in his boys, in camp and club, the practical application of what they have been learning in theory in the school.

In denominational Troops there is, as a rule, a Troop Chaplain, and the Scoutmaster should, as stated in Clause 2 of our Headquarters Religious Policy, consult with him on all questions of religious instruction.

It should be clearly understood that a Troop can be confined entirely to one particular church or denomination (for example, Church of England officers and boys, Roman Cathoics, Wesleyans, or the like).

For the purpose of its religious training, a service or class can be held, called a "Scouts' Own," "Scout Guild," or other such name as may be thought best. I commend to your careful consideration and study the valuable and interesting results of the Manchester Conference on the subject of "How to Run a Scouts' Own."

The majority, however, of our Troops are interdenominational, having boys of different forms of belief in their ranks.

For these Troops a Chaplain seems hardly required, because the boys should be sent to their own clergy and pastors for denominational religious instruction.

Still, for many of these Troops a "Scout's Own" or class of some kind on a Sunday has been found very helpful for inspiring the right scout spirit, but they need to be organised and carried on with care and tact. THe Scoutmaster shoudl always consult the parents and the boys, clergy and pastors, as a first step.

Other Troops in slums have lads of practically no religion of any kind, and their parents are little or no help to them. Naturally, these require different handling and methods of training from those boys in whom religion has been well grounded.

Here, again, Scouting comes very practically to the aid of the teacher, and has already given extraordinarily good results.

The practical way in which Scouting can help is through the following:—

    *(a)* Personal example of the Scoutmaster.
    *(b)* Nature study.
    *(c)* Good turns.
    *(d)* Missioner service.
    *(e)* Retention of the older boy.

C> *(a) Personal example.*

It is a common saying that an Englishman hates parading his religion; that he is often a man who does his duties from a religious conviction, but does not "for a pretence make long prayers" in public.

There is no doubt whatever that in the boys' eyes it is what a man does that counts and not so much what he says.

A Scoutmaster has, therefore, the greatest responsibility on his shoulders for doing the right thing from the right motives, and for letting it be seen that he does so, but without making a parade of it.

Here the attitude of elder brother rather than of teacher tells with the greater force.

C> *(b) Nature study.*

It has been said that "more men have been led to God through His handiwork than have ever been introduced by the preacher."

"Sermons in stones?" Yes, there are sermons in the observation of Nature, say, in bird life, the formation of every feather identical with that of the same species 10,000 miles away, the migration, the nesting, the colouring of the egg, the growth of the young, the mothering, the feeding, the flying power—all done without the aid of man, but under the law of the Creator; these are the best of sermons for boys.

The flowers in their orders, and plants of every kind, their buds and bark, the animals and their habits and species; then the stars in the heavens, with their appointed places and ordered moves in space, give to every one the first conception of Infinity and of the vast scheme of his Creator where man is of so small account. All these have a fascination for boys, which appeals in an absorbing degree to their inquisitiveness and powers of observation, and leads them directly to recognise the hand of God in this world of wonders, if only some one introduces them to it.

The wonder to me of all wonders is how some teachers have neglected this easy and unfailing means of *education* and have struggled to impose Biblical *instruction* as the first step towards getting a restless, full-spirited boy to think of higher things.

C> *(c) Good Turns.*

With a little encouragement on the part of the Scoutmaster the practice of daily Good Turns soon becomes a sort of fashion with boys, and it is the very best step towards making a Christian in fact, and not merely in theory. The boy has a natural instinct for good if he only sees a practical way to exercise it, and this Good Turn business meets it and develops it, and in developing it brings out the spirit of Christian charity towards his neighbour.

This expression of his will to good, is more effective, more natural to the boy, and more in accordance with the Scout method than his passive acceptance of instructive precepts.

C> *(d) Missioner service.*

The development is then carried on to a higher and wider standard through the practice of the test-items of the Missioners' Social Service Badge.

C> *(e) Retention of the older boy.*

So soon as the ordinary boy begins to get a scholastic knowledge of reading, writing, and arithmetic, he is sent out into the world, at the age of fourteen, as fit and equipped for making his career as a good working citizen.

Excellent technical schools are open to him, as well as continuation classes, if he likes to go to them, or if his parents insist on his attending after his day's work is over. The best boys go, and get a good final polish.

But what about the average and the bad? They are allowed to slide away—just at the one period of their life when they most of all need continuation and completion of what they have been learning, just at the time of their physical, mental and moral change into what they are going to be for the rest of their life.

The new Education Act is to correct this, but only promises to do so in a technical and partial manner.

This is where the Scout Movement can do so much for the lad, and it is for this important work that we are doing all we can to organise the Senior Scouts in order to retain the boy, to keep in touch with him, and to inspire him with the best ideals at this, his crossroads for good or evil.

## Self-Respect

In speaking of the forms of reverence which the boy should be encouraged to develop, we must not omit the important one of reverence for himself, that is self-respect in its highest form.

This, again, can well be inculcated through nature study as a preliminary step. The anatomy of plants, or birds, or shell-fish may be studied and shown to be the wonderful work of the Creator. Then the boy's own anatomy can be studied in a similar light; the skeleton and the flesh, muscle, nerves, and sinews built upon it, the blood flow and the breathing, the brain and control of action, all repeated, down to the smallest details, in millions of human beings, yet no two are exactly alike in face or finger prints. Raise the boy's idea of the wonderful body which is given to him to keep and develop as God's own handiwork and temple; one which is physically capable of good work and brave deeds if guided by sense of duty and chivalry, that is by a high moral tone.

Thus is engendered self-respect.

This, of course, must not be preached to a lad in so many words and then left to fructify, but should be inferred and expected in all one's dealings with him. Especially it can be promoted by giving the boy responsibility, and by trusting him as an honourable being to carry out his duty to the best of his ability, and by treating him with respect and consideration, without spoiling him.

## Selfishness

If I were asked what is the prevailing vice in the world I should say - Selfishness. You may not agree with this at first sight, but look into it and I believe you will come to the same conclusion. Most crimes, as recognised by law, come from the indulgence of selfishness, from a desire to acquire, to defeat, or to wreak vengeance. The average man will gladly give a contribution to feed the poor and will feel satisfied that he has then done his duty, but he is not going to dock himself of his own food and good wine to effect a saving for that purpose.

Selfishness exists in a thousand different ways. Take, for instance, party politics. Men here get to see a question, which obviously has two sides to it, exactly as if there were only one possible side, namely, their own, and they then get to hate another man who looks upon it from the other side. The result may lead men on to commit the greatest crimes under high-sounding names. In the same way, wars between nations have come about from neither party being able to see the other's point of view, being obsessed entirely by their own interests. Strikes, too, and lockouts are frequently the outcome of developed selfishness. In many cases, employers have failed to see that a hard-working man should, in justice, get a share of the goods of the world in return for his effort, and not be condemned to perpetual servitude simply to secure a certain margin of profits for the shareholders. On the other hand, the worker has to recognise that without capital there would be no work on a large scale, and there can be no capital without some return to the subscribers for the risks they face in subscribing.

In one's newspaper every day one sees examples of selfishness when one reads the letters of these small-minded men who, at every little grievance, rush headlong to

"write to the papers." And so it goes on, down to the children playing their games in the streets; the moment that one is dissatisfied at not getting his share of winning he abruptly leaves the scene remarking: "I shan't play any more!" The fact that he upsets the fun of the others does not appeal to him - unless it be satisfying to his spite.

## To Eradicate Selfishness - The Good Turn Habit

The Scouting practices tend in a practical way to educate the boy out of the groove of selfishness. Once he becomes charitable he is well on the way to overcome or to eradicate the danger of this habit.

The Promise that a Scout makes on joining has as its first point: "To do my duty to God." Note that it does not say "To be loyal to God," since this would merely be a state of mind, but to do something, which is the positive, active attitude.

The main method in the Boy Scout Movement is to give some form of positive training rather than merely to inculcate negative precepts, since the boy is always ready to do rather than to digest. Therefore, we put into his activities the practice of Good Turns in his daily life as a foundation of future goodwill and helpfulness to others. The religious basis underlying this is common to all denominations, and we, therefore, interfere with the form of none.

The boy can then realise better that part of his "Duty to God" is to take care of and develop as a sacred trust those talents with which God has equipped him for his passage through this life; the body with its health and strength and reproductive powers to be used in God's service; the mind with its wonderful reasoning, memory and appreciation, which place him above the animal world; and the soul, that bit of God which is within him - namely, Love, which can be developed and made stronger by continual expression and practice. Thus we teach him that to do his Duty to God means, not merely to lean on His kindness, but to do His will by practising love towards one's neighbour.

The curious thing is that this duty of Service for Others through Good Turns is the one to which Scouts rise with the fullest alacrity. On this seemingly small foundation (the giving up of small personal conveniences or pleasures in order to render service) is built the character of self-sacrifice for others. The minor Good Turns which are part of the Scout's faith are in themselves the first step. Nature study and making friends with animals increase the kindly feeling within him and overcome the trait of cruelty which is said to be inherent in every boy (although, personally, I am not sure that it is so general as is supposed). From these minor Good Turns he goes on to learn first aid and help to the injured, and in the natural sequence of learning how to save life in the case of accidents, he develops a sense of duty to others and a readiness to sacrifice himself in danger. This, again, leads up to the idea of sacrifice for others, for his home, and for his country, thereby leading to patriotism and loyalty of a higher type than that of merely ecstatic flag-waving.

## Service for the Community

The teaching of service is not merely a matter of teaching in theory, but the devel- opment of two distinct phases - the inculcation of the spirit of goodwill; and the provision of opportunity for its expression in practice.

The teaching is mainly through example, and the Scoutmaster gives exactly the right lead in his patriotic dedication of self to the service of the boy, solely for the joy of doing it, and without thought of material reward.

The opportunity for practice is given by the Scoutmaster suggesting to his boys special service projects.

Public services offer the best opening for practical training in sense of duty to the community, patriotism and self-sacrifice through expression.

The work of Scouts during peace and during wars in voluntarily taking up arduous duties in service of their country is in itself a proof of the keenness of the lads to do good work, and of their readiness to make themselves efficient where they see a good object. In this direction lies a powerful means of developing on practical lines the ideal of citizenship.

As one specific example of public service might be mentioned Boy Scout Acci- dent and Fire Service (Emergency Service) for towns and villages. Such service is especially applicable to Senior Scouts, and acts as an attractive force to the older boy while giving him public services to train for and to render.

The Troop is organised, equipped, and trained primarily for fire fighting, but with the further ability to deal with all kinds of accidents that, are possible in the neighbourhood, such, for instance, as: Street accidents; gas, chemical or other explosions; floods or inundations; electric accidents; railway accidents; fallen trees or buildings; ice accidents; bathing or boating accidents; airplane crashes; etc.

This would demand, in addition to the drill, rescue and first aid required for fire work, knowledge and practice in methods of extricating and rescuing, and rendering the proper first aid in each class of work; such as: Knowledge of gases and chemicals; handling of boats, improvising rafts, use of life line; use of lifebuoys, life saving in the water, artificial respiration; how to deal with frightened animals; how to deal with electric live wires, burning liquids; etc.

In some cases it may be best for each Patrol to specialise in a particular form of accident, but generally if the Patrols practise all in turn they arrive at complete efficiency for the whole Troop. Organisation for an accident would, however, confer specific duties on each Patrol, e.g., a Patrol of rescuers, first aiders, crowd holders, messengers, etc.

The variety of work to be done supplies a whole series of activities such as should appeal to the boys.

Frequent mobilizations to practise on improvised accidents are essential to at- taining efficiency and keenness.

As efficiency becomes evident public interest will be aroused probably to a helpful degree. The scheme will then be recognised as having a double value, an education for the boys, and a blessing for the community.

## Ulterior Effect

The repression of self and development of that love and service for others, which means God within, bring a total change of heart to the individual and with it the glow of true Heaven. It makes a different being of him.

The question becomes for him not "What can I get?", but "What can I give in life?"

No matter what may be his ultimate form of religion, the lad will have grasped for himself its fundamentals, and knowing these through practising them he becomes a citizen with a widened outlook of kindliness and sympathy for his brother men.

## Chivalry and Fair Play

The code of the medieval knights has been the foundation for the conduct of gen- tlemen ever since the day around A.D. 500, when King Arthur made the rules for his Knights of the Round Table. The romance of the Knights has its attraction for all boys and has its appeal to their moral sense. Their Code of Chivalry included Honour, Self-Discipline, Courtesy, Courage, Selfless Sense of Duty and Service, and the guidance of Religion.

The rules as they were republished in the time of Henry VII are as follow:-

1. They were never to put off their armour, except for the purpose of rest at night.
2. They were to search for adventures wherein to attain "bruyt and renown."
3. To defend the poor and weak.
4. To give help to any who should ask it in a just quarrel.
5. Not to offend one another.
6. To fight for the defence and welfare of their country.
7. To work for honour rather than profit.
8. Never to break a promise for any reason whatever.
9. To sacrifice themselves for the honour of their country.
10. "Sooner choose to die honestly than to flee shamefully."

The ideals of the Knights and the idea of fair play is above all the one which can be best instilled into boys and leads them to that strong view of justice which should be part of their character, if they are going to make really good citizens.

This habit of seeing things from the other fellow's point of view can be developed in outdoor games where fair play is essential, whether it is in "Flag Raiding" or "Dispatch Running." During the game the strictest rules are observed which mean self-restraint and good temper on the part of the players, and at the end it is the proper form that the victor should sympathise with the one who is conquered, and that the opponent should be the first to cheer and congratulate the winner.

This should be made the practice until it becomes the habit. A further valuable aid to the training in fairness is the holding of debates amongst the boys on subjects that interest them and which lend themselves to argument on both sides. This is to get them into the way of recognizing that every important question has two sides to it, and that they should not be carried away by the eloquence of one orator before they have heard what the defender of the other side has to say on the subject, and that they should then weigh the evidence of both sides for themselves before making up their mind which part they should take.

A practical step in ensuring this is not to vote by show of hands, where the hesitating or inattentive boy votes according to the majority. Each should record his vote "ay" or "no" on a slip of paper and hand it in. This ensures his making up his mind for himself after duly weighing both sides of the question.

In the same, way mock trials or arbitration of quarrels, if carried out seriously and on the lines of a law court, are of the greatest value in teaching the boys the same idea of justice and fair play, and also give them a minor experience of what their civic duties may be as jurymen or witnesses later on. The Court of Honour in the Troop is another step in the same direction, and as the boys here have a real responsibility by being members of the Court, the seriousness of their views is brought home to them a11 the more, and encourages them to think out carefully the right line to take when they have heard all the arguments on both sides.

Thus a Scoutmaster, who uses his ingenuity towards the end of teaching fair play, unselfishness and sense of duty to others, may make ample opportunities, whether indoors or out, for training his Scouts. Of all the subjects with which we are dealing, I believe this to be one of the most important towards self-governing citizenship, though I fear I have only touched upon it in a very sketchy manner.

## Proficiency Badges (Merit Badges)

Proficiency Badges are established with a view to developing in each lad the taste for hobbies or handicrafts, one of which may ultimately give him a career and not leave him hopeless and helpless on going out into the world.

The Badges are merely intended as an encouragement to a boy to take up a hobby or occupation and to make some sort of progress in it; they are a sign to an outsider that he has done so; they are, not intended to signify that he is a master in the craft he is tested in. If once we make Scouting into a formal scheme of serious instruction in efficiency, we miss the whole point and value of Scout training, and we trench on the work of the schools without the trained experts for carrying it out. We want to get all our boys along through cheery self-development from within and not through the imposition of formal instruction from without.

But the object of the Badge System in Scouting is also to give the Scoutmaster an instrument by which he can stimulate keenness on the part of every and any boy to take up hobbies that can be helpful in forming his character or developing his skill.

It is an instrument which - if applied with understanding and sympathy - is designed to give hope and ambition even to the dullest and most backward, who would otherwise be quickly outdistanced and so rendered hopeless in the race of life. It is for this reason that the standard of proficiency is purposely left undefined. Our standard for Badge earning is not the attainment of a certain level of quality of knowledge or skill, but the **amount of effort the boy has put into acquiting such knowledge or skill**. This brings the most hopeless case on to a footing of equal possibility with his more brilliant or better-off brother.

An understanding Scoutmaster who has made a study of his boys' psychology can thus give to the boy an encouraging handicap, such as will give the dull boy a fair start alongside his betterbrained brother. And the backward boy, in whom the inferiority complex has been born through many failures, can have his first win or two made easy for him so that he is led to intensify his efforts. If he is a trier, no matter how clumsy, his examiner can accord him his Badge, and this generally inspires the boy to go on trying till he wins further Badges and becomes normally capable.

The examination for Badges is not competitive, but just a test for the individual. The Scoutmaster and the examiner must therefore work in close harmony, judging each individual case on its merits, and discriminating where to be generous and where to tighten up.

Some are inclined to insist that their Scouts should be firstrate before they can get a Badge. That is very right, in theory; you get a few boys pretty proficient in this way - but our object is to get all the boys interested. The Scoutmaster who puts his boys at an easy fence to begin with will find them jumping with confidence and keenness, whereas if he gives them an upstanding stone wall to begin, it makes them strong.

At the same time, we do not recommend the other extreme, namely, that of almost giving away the Badges on very slight knowledge of the subjects. It is a matter where examiners should use their sense and discretion, keeping the main aim in view.

There is always the danger of Badge-hunting supplanting Badge-earning. Our aim is to make boys into smiling, sensible, self-effacing, hardworking citizens, instead of showy, self-indulgent boys. The Scoutmaster must be on the alert to check Badge- hunting and to realise which is the Badge-hunter and which is the keen and earnest worker.

Thus the success of the Badge System depends very largely on the Scoutmaster himself and his individual handling of it.

## Self-Expression

Our Art Badge is devised to lead boys on to express their ideas graphically from their own observation or imagination without attempting thereby to be or to imitate artists. By encouraging drawing, however crude, on the part of the youngster, he can be led on to recognise beauty in color or in form, to realise that even in sordid surroundings there may yet be light and shadow, color and beauty.

A further stage in his education can be brought about by getting him to practice mental photography, that is to notice the details of a scene or incident or person, and fix these in his mind, and then to go and reproduce them on paper.

This teaches observation in the highest degree. Personally I have found by prac- tice that one can develop a certain and considerable power in this direction.

Rhythm is a form of art which comes naturally even to the untrained mind, whether it be employed in poetry or music or in body exercises. It gives a balance and order which has its natural appeal even and especially among those closest to nature-savages. In the form of music it is of course most obvious and universal. The Zulu War Song when sung by four or five thousand warriors is an example of rhythm, in music, poetry and bodily movement combined.

The enjoyment of rendering music is common to all the human family, The song as a setting to words enables the soul to give itself expression which, when adequately done, brings pleasure both to the singer and to his hearer.

Through his natural love of music the boy can be linked up with poetry and sentiment as by a natural and easy transition. It opens a ready means to the Scoutmaster of teaching happiness to his lads and at the same time of raising the tone of their thoughts.

Play-acting also ought to form part of every boy's education for self-expression.

At school I was encouraged to do a lot of play-acting and I have thanked my stars ever since that I did so. For one thing it taught me to learn yards of stuff by heart; also accustomed me to speak clearly and without nervousness before a lot of people; and it gave me the novel joy of being someone else for a time.

It led one to know the beauties of Shakespeare and other authors, to feel, while expressing them, the emotions of joy and sorrow, love and sympathy.

Above all it gave one the pleasure and happiness of giving pleasure to other people at times when they needed it.

Many troops are giving entertainments in the winter months and are thus not only earning satisfactory additions to their funds, but are giving good training to their boys and pleasure to others.

## From Hobby to Career

Hobbies, handcraft, intelligence and health are preliminary steps for developing love of work and ability to carry on, which are essential to successful work. The second stage is fitting the young worker to the right kind of work.

The best workers, like the happiest livers, look upon their work as a kind of game: the harder they play the more enjoyable it becomes. H. G. Wells has said:-

> I have noticed that so called great men are really boys at heart, that is, they are boys in the eagerness of their enjoyment of their task. They work because they like to work, and thus their work is really play to them. The boy is not only father to the man, but he is the man and does not disappear at all.

Ralph Parlette says truly:-

> Play is Loving to do things, and Work is Having to do things.

In Scouting we try to help the boys acquire this attitude, by making them person- ally enthused in subjects that appeal to them individually, and that will be helpful to them later on.

We do this first and foremost through the fun and jollity of Scouting. The boys can then by progressive stages be led on naturally and unconsciously to develop themselves for their future.
