# The Attitude of Labour Towards Scouting

### American Approval of our Principles

A very suggestive book at the present critical time, when we are trying to see the right direction in which to point our boys' noses is *The Problems of Reconstruction,* published by Fisher Unwin. One among very many of its themes of thought is the view, quoted in his chapter on "The Influence of Vocation on School Education" - namely, that "Education in Continuation Schools should be directed solely towards the development of the bodies, minds, and characters of the pupils, and should be intimately related to their environment and interest." Giving due elasticity to the meaning of the word "solely" and "environment" is this statement, one can claim that our aims in the Scout Movement accord very closely with the idea of the Workers' Education Association. And if these embody the views of the Labour generally we are working as is our aim in sympathy with them.

Indeeed, in America the Labour Party have made a definite pronouncement on the Scout Movement. On the personal side their opinion of me was distinctly unflattering, though perhaps natural; but on the whole question it was favourable to us.

The American Federation of Labour held an inquiry in Illinois into the aims, methods, and organisation of the Boy Scouts of America, and this was the conclusion they came to.

"In the Boy Scout Movement part is good and part is bad. The bad part comes from England, and was devised by General Baden-Powell.... He was a commander in the Boer War, and could not help seeing how much inferior the British soldiers were to the Boers. He set to work his Boy Scout Movement, which would give the British soldiers the physical stamina of the Boers, and at the same time hold them in subserviency to the employing interest."

So there you have the objects that underlie Scouting fully exposed!

I never stated these points to in the Handbook, nor do I think they can be quite correct, for I devised Scouting *before* the Boer War took place; and in that war I never noticed this marked inferiority of the British soldier to the Boer; nor does subserviency fit in with our expressed aim of developing the individual standing in the initiative of the boy.

However, having vented their objection to me the committee eventually took the right line and approved the principles of the Movement in a resolution to the effect that - "Inasmuch as the Movement of the Boy Scouts of America is under the watchful eye of the officers of the American Federation of Labour, your committee recomend that we approve of this organisation, and that we be guided by the conclusions till we feel justified in following some other course.

"We furhter recommend that the United States Boy Scout organisation (an imitation Movement) be disapproved of, and all other independent movements of similar character, because of their teachings of militarism and blind obedience and subserviency to the employing interest.

"In recommending approval of the Boy Scouts of America, we suggest that this organisation be urged to a constantly closer sympathetic attitude towards the organized Labour Movement in its work and struggle for the achievement of higher material, political, moral, and social standard for the toilers of our country."

Barring the political side of the question, that is just what we are after. I feel all the more confident now, that our aims in teh Scout Movement will commend themselves to those who are endeavouring to better the conditions of the working man, since we encourage the boy to develop his individuality in character and intelligence, in skill and handicraft, in health and strength, and in service for his fellows; and these are essentially on the line desired for putting the next generation on to a better footing for carrying out for themselves prosperous careers and for enjoying to greater fullness, the life that God has given them.

We want to give to every boy - especially the poorest - his chance to succeed in life.
